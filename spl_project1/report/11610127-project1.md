# Compilers Project1 - Scanner & Parser

## Pre-requisite

Since I'm using c++ to compile flex and bison files, **g++** supporting **c++17** is required.



## Scanner

#### Self defined class:

###### <scanner.hpp>:

1. `SPL_Scanner : public yyFlexLexer` 
   Handle scan process and scanner error report process using `yylex` and `add_error` `error_reported`.
2. `Error` & `Lexical_Error : public Error` & `Syntax_Error : public Error`:
   - The encountered error would be encapsulated into Lexical or Syntax Error and added to the vector `lexical_errors` in `SPL_Driver`.
   - The `Lexical_Error` and `Syntax_Error` have different behavior (Type A and B) in `to_string` function, which is used in the error report process.
3. `Scan_Info`:
   The scanned lexeme and line number would be encapsulated into `Scan_Info` in flex file and used in bison file as information obtained from scanner.



#### Error report block

```c++
{ILLEGAL_HEX_INT} {
	add_error(new Scan_Info(std::string(yytext), yylineno));
	yylval->build<Scan_Info*>(new Scan_Info(std::string("0"), yylineno));
    return token::INT;
}
```

This block would first call `add_error` to add a lexical error into `lexical_errors`, and build a dummy `Scan_Info`, which would be sent into bison file.





## Parser

#### Self defined class:

###### <spl_driver.hpp>:

1. `SPL_Driver`:
   - Handle parse process by calling `SPL_Parser` class, which is generated by bison compiler. 
   - The error report of parser is also handled there. The `Error` vector: `syntax_errors` would record all the syntax error instead of lexical error. 
   - The `Program_Node` root is defined there. The root would be set using `set_root()` called in bison file.



#### Error report block

```c++
  | Specifier %prec ERROR {
  	driver.add_syntax_error(";", $1);
  }
```

Since I don't find a proper way to get location in the bison-defined `error` function, I choose to call the driver to do syntax report at some production.



## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

#### Self defined class & functions:

###### <ast.hpp>:

1. `AST_Node`:
   The base class of all the AST node class.
   - Contains a `line_no` member to record the earliest occurred line number of node.
   - Contains a `propagate_line_no` function to retrieve the line number of children recursively.
2. Other sub-class of `AST_Node`:
   They represent different kinds of nodes.
3. `void print_ast(AST_Node *node, int indent_level = 0);`
   Using back-tracking algorithm to print the AST using pre-defined format.



## Features

#### Required

1. Error report:
   Done by `errors` which consists of all the errors reported by scanner and parser. In the main function, if the `errors` is not empty, it will output error reports instead of AST.
2. Valid program
   Done by constructing a `AST` class in bison file. The main function would call the `print_ast()` to recursively print the AST.



#### Optional

1. Single-line and Multi-line comments:
   Done in flex files by recognizing these comments format:

   ```
   LINE_COMMENT            \/\/[^\n\r]*(\n|\r\n|\r)?
   MULTI_LINE_COMMENT      \/\*[^*]*\*+(?:[^/*][^*]*\*+)*\/
   ```

2. Hexadecimal representation of integers:
   Done in flex files:

   ```
   HEX_INT                 0[xX]([1-9A-Fa-f][0-9A-Fa-f]*|0)
   ILLEGAL_HEX_INT         0[xX]([0-9A-Za-z]*)
   ```

3. Hex-form characters:
   Done in flex files:

   ```
   HEX_CHAR                '\\x[0-9A-Fa-f][0-9A-Fa-f]'
   ILLEGAL_HEX_CHAR        '\\x[0-9A-Za-z]*'
   ```

4. Nested multi-line comments:
   Not implemented
