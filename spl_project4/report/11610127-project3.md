# Compilers Project3 - Code Generation

## Pre-requisite

Since I'm using c++ to compile flex and bison files, **g++** supporting **c++17** is required.



## Visitor

As is said in the project 2 report, I'm using Visitor Pattern to perform traversing of the AST.

Ref to Wiki:

> The visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.
>
> In essence, the visitor allows adding new virtual functions to a family of classes, without modifying the classes. Instead, a visitor class is created that implements all of the appropriate specializations of the virtual function. The visitor takes the instance reference as input, and implements the goal through double dispatch.



#### Self defined class:

###### <visitor.hpp>:

1. ```c++
   template<typename T, typename S, typename E>
       class AST_Visitor
   ```

   Interface for visitor pattern, which defines the `visit` functions as virtual function.

2. ```c++
   class Visitor : public AST_Visitor<void, void, Exp_Info *>
   ```

   Abstract base class for visiting Abstract Syntax Tree, which more concretely define how to visit children of AST Nodes in `visit_children(AST_Node *node)`



###### <tac.hpp>:

1. `Label`
   Defines the label representation ,which stores the name of label.
2. `Quadruple`
   The base class for all quadruples.
   Define the pure virtual function `to_string`, which is used in the IR generation.
3. `Label_Quadru : public Quadruple`, 
   `Func_Quadru : public Quadruple`...
   All the derivative class that represents the three address code structure.
4. `TAC`
   Container for the quadruple. Constructed by `std::vector`.



###### <ir.hpp>

1. `IR_Generator : public Visitor`
   Defines the visitor using Visitor Pattern to traverse the Abstract Syntax Tree, and generate `Quadruple`s.



###### <optimizer.hpp>

1. `Basic_Block`
   Defines the basic block consisting a portion of instructions.
2. `TAC_Optimizer`
   Optimizer that would perform local optimization such as Neutral elimination, Constant folding, Strenght reduction and Constant propagation. However, I fail to complete them.



## Features

#### Required

1. Generate given linear IR using spl file input.



#### Bonus

1. The structure can appear in the program, and they can be declared as function parameters.
2. Single-dimensional array can be declared as function parameters, and multi-dimensional arrays can be defined as local variables.
