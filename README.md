##### SUSTech Programming Language(SPL)

SPL is a C-like programming language that removes most advanced features in C standard,  such as macros or pointers.  It is strongly typed, with several primitive types and structure type (as we borrowed from C), and sup-ports C-like control flow such as if-statement and while-statement.  Also, it supports basic user interaction by providing two built-in function read and write, which makes it Turing-complete!
